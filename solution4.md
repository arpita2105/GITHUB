## Tag
- HTML tags are used to define and structure elements on a web page.
- Tags are written within angle brackets, e.g., <tagname>.
- Tags can be categorized as opening tags and closing tags.
- **Opening tags :** mark the beginning of an element, i.e. `<p>`
- **Closing tags :** mark the end of the element, i.e. `</p>`
- Tags define the nature of elements.

 - #### Types of HTML Tags :-
      
      - ##### Paired Tags
          - Paired tags consist of both an opening tag and a corresponding closing tag. 
          - Paired tags are also called container tags.
          - These tags enclose content within them and define the structure and hierarchy of the  document.
          - **Example :**

                   1- <div></div>
                   2- <p></p>
                   3- <h1></h1>
                   
      - ##### Unpaired Tags
          - Unpaired tags consist of a single tag without a corresponding closing tag. 
          - These tags do not enclose content but are used to insert standalone elements or resources (e.g., images, line breaks, input fields).
          - **Example :**
           
                   1- <img>
                   2- <br>
                   3- <input>
                   4- <meta>

 #### Example of HTML Tags :

            `<p> <!-- This is an HTML tag -->`        


In this example:
- `<p>` is the HTML tag.
- It does not contain content on its own; it merely defines a paragraph element.                 



## Element
- Elements encloses the contents in between the tags.
- Elements can contain various types of content such as text, images, links, or other elements.
- Elements define specific parts of a web page like paragraphs, headings, links, and images.
- Elements are what browsers render and display to users, making up the visible content of a web page.
- HTML Element consists of 3 parts :-
   - **Opening Tag :** The opening tag marks the beginning of an element and typically includes the element's name, such as `<p>` for a paragraph.
   - **Closing Tag :** The closing tag marks the end of an element and is the same as the opening tag but with a forward slash, such as `</p>`.
   - **Content :** The content placed between the opening and closing tags is the actual text or data associated with the element.

   
  #### Example of HTML Element :
   
             `<p>This is a paragraph.</p> <!-- This is an HTML element -->`


In this example:
- `<p>` is the opening tag.
- This is a paragraph. is the content.
- `</p>` is the closing tag.
- Together, they create an HTML element that represents a paragraph.
